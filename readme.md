# NEVERBLAND Coding Challenge

## Brief

We built a prototype of an application that let the user search for a movie and get some information about it. This application has to be simple but can potentially scale as a mid-range project in the future.

We just received the design from the graphic designer and it needs to be implemented.

How would you refactor this application using your own methods and workflow?
How would you implement the design?

The features of the app:
- Search for movies using the API http://www.omdbapi.com/
- Display a list of results
- Sort the results
- Let the user click and have more informations about a movie

We just want to have a taste of your way of working with design and code!

Happy coding!

Hello!

Welcome to my coding challenge solution.

As the functionality was essentially there in the starter-code, I decided to concentrate on getting the content correct (eg the right movie type) and the styling and responsivity as good as possible, as well as fine-tuning the functionality â€“ eg making use of the submit button on the form and sorting the results with buttons rather than with radio buttons.

The sizing is an approximation and I feel the responsivity is a bit crude. I would have liked to spend more time refining both.


## With more time...

With more time I would have liked to have separated the JS code to become object-oriented (I started this with the Content object).

As the brief mentioned scalability, I considered using AngularJS to display the results area, render the cards and operate the sort function. Again, time was a factor here, so I decided to work with the jQuery-based funcationality rather than start again from scratch. I also had a question in my mind about how scalable this app is, given that it already makes use of all the data available. So I would ideally want to know more about this before deciding whether to use AngularJS or not. 

Although working with HTML in the JS files is not ideal, it is relatively simple to a point.

Hello!

Welcome to my coding challenge solution.

As the functionality was essentially there in the starter-code, I decided to concentrate on getting the content correct (eg the right movie type) and the styling and responsivity as good as possible, as well as fine-tuning the functionality â€“ eg making use of the submit button on the form and sorting the results with buttons rather than with radio buttons.

The sizing is an approximation and I feel the responsivity is a bit crude. I would have liked to spend more time refining both.


## With more time...

With more time I would have liked to have separated the JS code to become object-oriented (I started this with the Content object).

As the brief mentioned scalability, I considered using AngularJS to display the results area, render the cards and operate the sort function. Again, time was a factor here, so I decided to work with the jQuery-based functionality rather than start again from scratch. I also had a question in my mind about how scalable this app is, given that it already makes use of all the data available. So I would ideally want to know more about this before deciding whether to use AngularJS or not. 

Although working with HTML in the JS files is not ideal, I felt that it was a relatively simple and lightweight solution to the brief as it stands.
